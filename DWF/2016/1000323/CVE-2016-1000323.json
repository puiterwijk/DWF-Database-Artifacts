{"description": [{"lang": "eng","value": "The request phase of OmniAuth is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery. This is the step that actually connects an external account (on a connected OAuth provider) to an internal account (on the web application itself). This means that when a client is signed into an account on the web application, and signed into an account on a connected OAuth provider, these two accounts can be connected without user intent, user interaction or feedback to the user. From here on out, the external account can be used to sign into the web application as the internal account. If the sign in action at a connected OAuth provider is vulnerable to CSRF, an attacker can force the victim\u2019s client to be logged into the external service using an account belonging to the attacker, can then force this external account to be connected to the internal account, and can from here on out use their account on the external service to log into the victim\u2019s account on the targeted application."}],"assigner": "kurt@seifried.org","problem_types": [{"description": [{"lang": "eng","value": "CSRF"}]}],"references": [{"url": "https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/pull/809"}],"requester": "reed@reedloden.com","serial": "1","date_assigned": "2016-12-13T20:42:26.127133","date_requested": "9/23/2016 4:32:04","cve_id": "CVE-2016-1000323","notes": [{"lang": "eng","value": "This was submitted to oss-security last year (http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/05/26/11), but a CVE was never assigned, and the issue doesn't seem to have been fixed."}],"data_format": "MITRE","data_version": "3.1","state": "PUBLIC","products": [{"product": [{"version": "All current?","product_name": "OmniAuth"}],"vendor_name": "OmniAuth"}]}
