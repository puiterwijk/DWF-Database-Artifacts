{"description": [{"lang": "eng","value": " JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. Json string is decoded into hashmap without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) by sending crafted json string. We discover json-simple is  vulnerable to hash collisions DoS attacks, such as PHP, gson and jsonp libraries when they running at JDK 6.x and 7.x.
