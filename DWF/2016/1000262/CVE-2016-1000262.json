[sanitizing rx_ptr]\n\nMissing input validation on the ring rx_ptr in v4v_ringbuf_insert and\nv4v_ringbuf_insertv allows a buggy or malicious guest VM to supply a large\nrx_ptr value exceeding the size of the ring, which then enables the same VM to\noverwrite a large region of memory in the ring's destination VM via the\nv4v_send or v4v_sendv hypercall operations.\n\n* Vulnerability type:\nGain Privilege, Denial of Service, Overflow, Bypass, Memory Corruption\n\n====\n2. [v4v_ringbuf_insertv, length checks]\n\nIn v4v_sendv, the data length is retrieved by v4v_iov_count and used for bounds\nchecking in v4v_ringbuf_insertv, but the data copy loop independently retrieves\nthe iovs from the guest and the length retrieved by the second copy may differ.\n\nBounds checking on the length of the data supplied by the user is missing,\nwhich allows the VM to overwrite a large region of memory in the ring's\ndestination VM.\n\n* Vulnerability type:\nGain Privilege, Denial of Service, Overflow, Bypass, Memory Corruption\n\n====\nPatch that implements fixes:\nhttps://github.com/OpenXT/xenclient-oe/pull/343\n\nDefect report ticket:\nhttps://openxt.atlassian.net/browse/OXT-653\n\n====\n* Affected software versions: all versions of OpenXT prior to 6.0.0\n\n* CVE identifiers have not been requested anywhere else."}],"data_format": "MITRE","data_version": "3.1","state": "PUBLIC","products": [{"product": [{"version": "All versions prior to 6.0.0","product_name": "OpenXT"},{"affects": "FIXED","version": "6.0.0","product_name": "OpenXT"}],"vendor_name": "The OpenXT Project"}]}
